# [All Pairs with Diff k](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pairs-with-difference-k1713/1)
## Easy
Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Find the number of pairs of integers whose absolute difference equals to a given number k.Note: (a, b) and (b, a) are considered the same. Also, the same numbers at different indices are considered different.
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 1, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 pairs with absolute difference 3, the pairs are {1, 4}, {1, 4}, {4, 1} and {1, 4}.
Input: arr[] = [8, 16, 12, 16, 4, 0], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 pairs with absolute difference 4, the pairs are {8, 12}, {8, 4}, {16, 12}, {12, 16}, {4, 0}.
Constraints:1 &lt;= arr.size() &lt;= 2*1051 &lt;= k &lt;= 2*1050 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 105
