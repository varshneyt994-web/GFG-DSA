# [Implement Upper Bound](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-upper-bound/1)
## Easy
Given a&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;array&nbsp;arr[]&nbsp;and a number&nbsp;target, the task is to find the&nbsp;upper bound&nbsp;of the&nbsp;target in this given array.The&nbsp;upper bound&nbsp;of a number is defined as the smallest&nbsp;index&nbsp;in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.
Note:&nbsp;If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the&nbsp;target, the upper bound will be the length of the array.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[6] = 25) is larger than 11.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100
Output: 7
Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater than 100, return the length of array.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1061 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1061 ≤ target ≤ 106
