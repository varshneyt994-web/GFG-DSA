# [Floor in a Sorted Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1)
## Easy
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.
Note: In case of multiple occurrences of floor of x, return the index of the last occurrence.
Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: Largest Number less than or equal to 11 is 10, whose indices are 3 and 4. The index of last occurrence is 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 0Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than or equal to 0 is found. So, output is -1.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1061 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1060 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]
